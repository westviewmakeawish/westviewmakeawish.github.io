# Olivia

"Olivia loves playing with her younger sister Abigail, her dog Violet, playing outside, camping and animals. Olivia has been battling leukemia since 2021 and has recently become cancer free! We are so thankful for the staff at Doernbecher, our friends, family community, Westview High School and anyone who supports organizations like Make-a-Wish and that do their best to keep children's lives happy and healthy during these difficult times" \
*-Olivia's Mom*
