Asher is a 3-year-old who lives in Hillsboro and wished to meet Mickey Mouse. His recent favorite song is 5 little monkeys, but he also likes the wheel on the bus, you are my sunshine, early episodes of cocomelon songs. Asher went to Westview's assembly in 2023 and is currently wishing it forward by doing his own fundraiser for Make-A-Wish.
